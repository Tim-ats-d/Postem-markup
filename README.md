# Postem

A fast and easy **notes taking** oriented **markup** language

## Abstracts

**Markdown** is pretty simple and powerful, but not suitable for note taking. **LaTeX** a very heavy syntax that makes it complicated to write  although very complete. **Postem** offers an in-between to quickly structure a text and compile it to other more conventional formats.

## Key Features

* **Lightweight:** a light syntax and a small number of marks.
* **Flexible:** it compiles to other famous markup languages such as **Markdown** and **HTML**.
* **Extensible:** it is very easy to create an expansion to customize the rendering.

#### Not yet implemented

* A Pandoc-repl like.
* Compilation to [**Pandoc**](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) format
* Unicode support outside of unformat expression.

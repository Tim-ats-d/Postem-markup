# Postem

A fast and WIP easy **notes taking** oriented **markup** language

## Abstracts

**Markdown** is pretty simple and powerful, but not suitable for note taking. **LaTeX** has a very heavy syntax that makes it complicated to write although very complete. **Postem** offers an in-between to quickly structure a text and compile it to other more conventional formats.

## Key Features

* **Lightweight:** a light syntax.
* **Flexible:** it compiles to other famous markup languages such as **AsciiDoc** and **Markdown**.
* **Extensible:** it is very easy to create an expansion to customize the rendering or extend available tags set using **OCaml**.

#### Not yet implemented

* Compilation to [**Pandoc**](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) format
